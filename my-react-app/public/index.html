      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <!--Got it! Here's a revised version of whimsical gibberish for website maintenance where the username "zyphorionq" is simply mentioned once in the context of logging in:

In the labyrinthine landscape of web wizardry, where code currents flow through the veins of the virtual vortex, the keepers of keystrokes and guardians of gateways work tirelessly to uphold the sanctity of cyber spaces. Deep within the circuit-clad caverns of this digital domain, there lies a hidden sanctum where the ancient arts of website maintenance are practiced with mystical fervor and techno-alchemical precision.

Once every blue moon, under the shimmering light of fiber-optic fireflies, the ritual begins with zyphorionq logging in using the arcane authentication amulet, a relic encoded with eons of encrypted energies. This sacred symbol serves as a beacon, banishing bytes of baleful bugs and summoning the sovereign spirits of site security.

With the gateway guardianed, the ritual proceeds to the delicate dance of data defragmentation. Here, spectral scribes sort through the sands of server memories, sieving stale snippets and polishing precious packets into pristine parcels of performance prowess. Each piece of purified data is then delicately dovetailed into the dynamic mosaic of the website, enhancing its essence and ensuring eternal equilibrium.

Next, the enchanted engineers conjure the cloud cauldrons, bubbling with the brew of bandwidth and bursting with the bolts of broadband. They stir the stew with the staff of speed optimization, each swirl syncing the site's soul with the pulsating pace of the planetary pulse.

As the cauldrons simmer, the spellcasters chant the canticles of cache cleansing, each verse vibrating through the vaults of the virtual venue, vaporizing vestiges of venerable versions and venerating the vitality of the viewer's voyage. This magical mantra maintains the momentum of the media, marshaling the multimedia mosaics into a mesmerizing montage of motion and mastery.

Attention then turns to the tapestries of traffic analysis, where the weavers of the web wield the looms of logistics. Threads of throughput and fibers of functionality are fused into a fabric of foresight, forecasting the flows and fluxes of future footfalls. This tapestry tells tales of traveler tendencies, guiding the guild of guardians to greet guests with grace and guarantee a gala of great gains.

To fortify the fortress of the frontend, the digital druids deploy the shields of SSL, each layer laminated with the lore of lattice cryptography. This invisible armor anoints the architecture, averting the arrows of adversary assaults and anchoring the assurance of anonymity.

In the penultimate phase, the wizards of the wireframe weave the widgets and the wonders, knitting knots of navigation with nimble notions. The interface is imbued with intuitive interactions, inviting the inhabitants of the internet into an immersive experience imbued with innovation and intuition.

Finally, the fellowship of the firewall gathers under the gleaming glyphs of the global gateway, reciting the resolutions of reliability and resilience. Their voices vault into the void, sealing the spell with the serenity of steadfast safeguarding.

Thus, through the twilight of their toils, the sentinels stand steadfast, safeguarding the sanctity of the site until the next cycle calls. The virtual vessel, veiled in the valor of vigilant vigilance, voyages valiantly through the vastness of the virtual void, a beacon of balance and beauty in the boundless beyond.-->
