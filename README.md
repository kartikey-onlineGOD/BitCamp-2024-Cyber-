# The Moth Challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to "The Moth Challenge", a set of puzzles designed to test and sharpen your cybersecurity skills. Inspired by the likes of Cicada 3301 and the CIA's cybersecurity tests, we have created an accessible and engaging platform for learners of all levels.

## Inspiration
Our journey began with inspiration from the infamous Cicada 3301 puzzles and the CIA's Cyber Security Intelligence Tests. We aimed to demystify the field of cybersecurity and make it engaging through gamified challenges. This platform is designed to be an entry point for anyone looking to delve into the world of cybersecurity.

## What We Learned
This project was as much a learning experience as it was a challenge. Our team, comprised mostly of novices in cybersecurity, dove headfirst into areas like cryptography, steganography, and web security. We implemented these using Python, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Flask, learning immensely along the way. Additionally, Firebase was utilized for backend services, introducing some of us to new technologies.

## How We Built It
**Frontend:**
- **React**: Used for crafting a user-friendly interface that adjusts dynamically to various puzzles.

**Backend:**
- **Flask**: Manages requests and serves the necessary content for each challenge.

**Programming:**
- Core logic and puzzles are written in **Python** and **JavaScript**, facilitating effective data manipulation and complex operations.

**Database & Hosting:**
- **Firebase**: Supports hosting and secure user data management.

## Challenges Faced
Our primary hurdle was our initial lack of deep cybersecurity knowledge, requiring extensive personal and group study. Integrating diverse technologies and debugging interactions between Python and JavaScript were significant challenges. Additionally, crafting puzzles that were challenging yet approachable for beginners tested our creative and technical skills.
